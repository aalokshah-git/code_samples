Baremetal firmare code pushed here was written by me back in 2014.  <br />
<br/>
The sensor is not in the existence, so this code is pushed for the reference. <br />
<br />
It is the firmware written over AVR-ATMEGA family. A reader or visitor of the repository can get following insgits looking at it - <br />
  1> Cascaded design of the firmware (HAL layer at bottom -> Driver level at middle -> Super-loop (main.c) at top dealing with middle layer <br />
  2> Writing of Baremetal driver for - I2C, UART, SPI <br />
  3> Communication driver of TI's CC2520  and CC1125 <br />
  4> Coding practices to write a professional code <br />
